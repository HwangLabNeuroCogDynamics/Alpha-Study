NOTES:
running through alpha eyetracker again to embed trial trigs in the csv output

sub196 eyetracking was processed without a calibration for reference. sub 196 eyetracking process gives an error, i just skipped it for now 

sub197 alpha has fewer bdf events than behavioral events, should feed in a shortened beahviroal log (cut out first 22 trials)
	-- I did this, looks ok now and has been preprocessed 

sub198 left early, has incomplete session. Where is bdf? Found bdf, but no eyetracking

sub211
	- metadata not matching bdf events, have to rerun subject 
	- manually relabeled the 'block' columns of ea behavioral log
	- this still didn't work?? cant figure out the issue here
	- didn't have an intact eyetracking script, which I think is part of the behavioral metadata problem. Ran the eyetrack preproc script
	- i think it should work now, finish the preproc

sub212 missing eyetracking testing, file is lost?
	their bdf was accidentally saved as eyetracking_testing,
	moved this to RDSS 

sub214, no triggers sent to eyetracker?

sub222, line noise makes it unusable

sub223 eyetracking ok

sub224, 
	- no eyetracking because of weird encoding,processed without eyes. Also had to fix the shortest_event thing. 
	- Had an extra block, I had to manually re-set the 'block' column to match the actual order for block 4-11
	- Because of incorrect behav files, the csv's and the bdf events arent exactly matched, causing incorrect metadata, so I had to re-process

sub225 eyetracking ok, 

sub226 eyetracking ok

sub228 eyetracking ok,
		trial # 48 from the first block had to be deleted from behav files bc the probe triggers for this trial were lost. The original files are ok for the other epochs, but I had to generate a truncated to match file for probes only

sub230, can't use because only four blocks were caught, no eyetracking

sub233, 
	- calibration is corrupt but I still processed the testing file. Processed EEG ok
	- have to rerun bc of issue with metadata not matching! Behav block 8 was labeled 7, manually readjusted
	- re-processed
