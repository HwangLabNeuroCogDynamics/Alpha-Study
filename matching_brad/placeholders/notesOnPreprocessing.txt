NOTES:
running through alpha eyetracker again to embed trial trigs in the csv output

sub196 eyetracking was processed without a calibration for reference. sub 196 eyetracking process gives an error, i just skipped it for now 

sub197 alpha has fewer bdf events than behavioral events, should feed in a shortened beahviroal log (cut out first 22 trials)
	-- I did this, looks ok now and has been preprocessed 

sub198 left early, has incomplete session. Where is bdf? Found bdf, but no eyetracking

sub211
	- metadata not matching bdf events, have to rerun subject 
	- manually relabeled the 'block' columns of ea behavioral log
	- this still didn't work?? cant figure out the issue here
	- didn't have an intact eyetracking script, which I think is part of the behavioral metadata problem. Ran the eyetrack preproc script
	- i think it should work now, finish the preproc

sub212 missing eyetracking testing, file is lost?
	their bdf was accidentally saved as eyetracking_testing,
	moved this to RDSS 

sub214, no triggers sent to eyetracker?

sub222, line noise makes it unusable

sub223 eyetracking ok

sub224, 
	- no eyetracking because of weird encoding,processed without eyes. Also had to fix the shortest_event thing. 
	- Had an extra block, I had to manually re-set the 'block' column to match the actual order for block 4-11
	- Because of incorrect behav files, the csv's and the bdf events arent exactly matched, causing incorrect metadata, so I had to re-process

sub225 eyetracking ok, 

sub226 eyetracking ok

sub228 eyetracking ok,
		trial # 48 from the first block had to be deleted from behav files bc the probe triggers for this trial were lost. The original files are ok for the other epochs, but I had to generate a truncated to match file for probes only

sub230, can't use because only four blocks were caught, no eyetracking

sub231, 

sub233, 
	- calibration is corrupt but I still processed the testing file. Processed EEG ok
	- have to rerun bc of issue with metadata not matching! Behav block 8 was labeled 7, manually readjusted
	- re-processed

sub234
	- multiple calibration and testing files, eyetracking processed ok?
	-

sub235
	- has eyetracking, looks ok
	- power spectrum looks insane, data unusuable
	- raw data looks ok
	- skipped preproc
	- Probably also an issue of the table

sub238 
	- has eyetracking
	- power spectrum also looks unusable
	- skipped preproc
	- This is Rukshad's subject with the line noise issue because of the motorized table lol

sub231
	- power spectrum looks ok, but raw data looks off
	- epochs data look weirdly fuzzy, raw data looks not fuzzy enough?
	- IC's are really bad, I pretty much rejected all of them?

sub239
	- preprocessed! don't use it though, only has 3 blocks and the sub was asleep pretty much the whole time

sub240
	- preprocessed ok!
	- eyetracking also ok 
	- power noise from table during first block, but we figured it out after that

sub244
	- errored out at first because has two extra rows in metadata than events? (602 v 600) fix this. It's because there's two extra rows of eyetracking. Had to manually delete the first 2 bc they're extra! Behavioral logs look ok tho
	-preprocessed

sub234
	- block 7 of behav file is accidentally repeated, have to manually adjust it to say 'block 8' before I process. FIXED!
	- 
	
sub245
	- battery on amp box ran out in between 2nd and 3rd blocks, have to concat two files? And it has too few trials

sub241
	- subject was fidgety, rejected a lot of epochs

sub237
	- looks normal
