NOTES:
running through alpha eyetracker again to embed trial trigs in the csv output

sub196 eyetracking was processed without a calibration for reference. sub 196 eyetracking process gives an error, i just skipped it for now 

sub197 alpha has fewer bdf events than behavioral events, should feed in a shortened beahviroal log (cut out first 22 trials)
	-- I did this, looks ok now and has been preprocessed 

sub198 left early, has incomplete session. Where is bdf? Found bdf, but no eyetracking

sub212 missing eyetracking testing, file is lost?
	their bdf was accidentally saved as eyetracking_testing,
	moved this to RDSS 

sub214, no triggers sent to eyetracker?

sub222, line noise makes it unusable

sub223 eyetracking ok

sub224, no eyetracking because of weird encoding :( processed without eyes. Also had to fix the shortest_event thing

sub225 eyetracking ok, 

sub226 eyetracking ok

sub228 eyetracking ok,
		trial # 48 from the first block had to be deleted from behav files bc the probe triggers for this trial were lost. The original files are ok for the other epochs, but I had to generate a truncated to match file for probes only

sub230, can't use because only four blocks were caught, no eyetracking

sub233, calibration is corrupt but I still processed the testing file. Processed EEG ok
